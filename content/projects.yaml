    Since I joined Nestlé, my top priority has been to help Nesté design, build
    and support a data-driven vision. I managed the release the best solutions
    to collect data and create personalized experience (Salesforce Marketing
    Cloud, SAP CDC, Drupal etc.). This  task required me to master several areas
    such as gigital presence, marketing automation and analytics.


    The results obtained have been impressive, our database more than doubled in
    the last 2 years and all our KPIs massively improved (OR, CTR, subscribers
    etc.).


    Our next steps  in the near future will be get ready for the new cookieless
    web and  setup a clear D2C strategy.

    While working in Amilon I worked on the development of a new in-house
    product. 

    The cross-functional project I managed developed a loyalty engine that
    enabled marketers to: 

    - design custom CRM programs,

    - integrate multiple online/offline data sources 

    - manage the earn & burn mechanics
