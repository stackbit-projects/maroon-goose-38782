    Since I joined Nestlé, my top priority has been to help Nesté design, build
    and support a data-driven vision. I managed the release the best solutions
    to collect data and create personalized experience. This  task required me
    to master several areas such as gigital presence, marketing automation and
    analytics.

    The results obtained have been massive, our database more than doubled in
    the last 2 years and the quality of data and interaction massively
    improved.

    enabled marketers to: 

    - design custom CRM programs,

    - integrate multiple online/offline data sources
